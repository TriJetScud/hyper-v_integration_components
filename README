Hyper-V Linux Integration Components 3.4 for Debian Squeeze (6) systems

	These drivers has been modified from the vanilla RHEL 6 version of
	Linux Integration Components.

	Before building this package, you'll need the following packages 
	installed on your system:
		linux-devel linux-headers build-essential

	After you have the following above installed, please run build_src as
	root to install the drivers.

	BIG WARNING: If you have a recent kernel (i.e. 3.2.x) installed, you do
	not need to use this package. Use those Hyper-V drivers instead of this
	package. This package is intended for people who wish to stay with the
	original kernel that Debian Squeeze shipped with!

	For legal reasons, this package did not originate from Microsoft in any
	form or shape. Use this code at your own risk.
